# 2048-3D
The popular game 2048 now for the 3DS.

This is currently in an early alpha version. You should always be able to compile the code and use the `.3dsx` version! If one of these do fail, please create an issue on this repo, so I can fix it.

## Plans:
* [ ] ~~Text version~~
* [x] Add basic GFX (Done)
* [ ] Animations
* [ ] Add better GFX
* [ ] Polish!

## Credits
* Jasper Peters (MrJPGames) - full game (GFX, code, etc.)
* Darrin Lin (Fancymans) - updating to the latest ctrulib (as of 15-8-15)

## Note
All executables except `.elf` are tested and working! `.elf` should work, as the `.cia` is made from the `.elf`, but as there is no way to launch `.elf` files on 3DS right now it cannot be tested on actual hardware, though it does work on emulators like `citra`.
